### Ground Penetrating Radar Data Analysis Tool

![ApInsight](images/ApInsight.jpg)

## Overview
ApInsight is a Python-based tool designed for analyzing and visualizing ground penetrating radar (GPR) data, particularly tailored for use with already processed 3D data blocks in the .fld file format. This format is exclusively created by the ApRadar software, developed by Geosphere Austria. ApInsight encompasses a suite of scripts for data visualization and analysis, enabling users to interpret GPR data with higher efficiency and accuracy. To facilitate exploration and understanding of its functionality, a sample dataset (https://github.com/erichnau/ApInsight-SampleData) is available in a separate repository, allowing interested individuals to engage with the tool's capabilities. It is compatible with both Windows and Linux operating systems. 

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface:** Offers an intuitive layout for easy navigation and interaction.
- **Project File Management:** Simplifies project setup, data handling, and management through various GUI components. Enables creation of project files in .json format containing links to necessary files and folders.
- **Data preprocessing:** Provides functions to create depth-slice images from .fld files and preprocess .fld files for fast visualization.
- **Depthslice Viewer:** Allows access to all depth-slice images defined in a project file, enabling simple switching between different datasets.
- **Measurement Tool:** Facilitates measurement of distances and areas on depth-slice images.
- **Drawing Tool:** Enables drawing, storing, and viewing of section lines on depth-slice images. Section lines can be stored in the project file and exported/imported to/from .shp files, allowing for interoperability with GIS software.
- **Section Tool:** Extracts arbitrary vertical sections through a chosen dataset along drawn section lines. Facilitates communication between the depth-slice viewer and section view for detailed data analysis. Allows for the export of section images as .png files.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
